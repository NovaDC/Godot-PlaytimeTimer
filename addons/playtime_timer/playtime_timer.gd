## PlaytimeTimer
##
## A count up timer specifically built to run for long period of time in a single scene.[br][br]
## NOTE: this timer itself is ignorant of multi session timing durations,
## so if it is unloaded or freed while active,
## it will loose count of all time it was counting all the way back to the last time it was stopped.
## The starting and stopping of timers on application load, quit, pause, and resume is expected to
## be handled externally by a [PlaytimeManagerNode]

## Emitted when this timer is started. [ts] is the timestame in usec that the timer was started at.
signal started(ts:int)
## Emitted when this timer is stopped. [ts] is the timestame in usec that the timer was stopped at.
signal stopped(int)
## Emitted when this timer is paused. [ts] is the timestame in usec that the timer was paused at.
signal paused(int)
## Emitted when this timer is resumed. [ts] is the timestame in usec that the timer was resumed at.
signal resumed(int)

## Weather or not this timer is active. Will start or stop the timer
## when set to the appropriate [bool] value.

## The current time, and a [int] of passed microseconds, including both
